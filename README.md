### Getting Started

Before using Monkeyking, you should already have [ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads) 2.5.0, and [rubygems](https://rubygems.org/pages/download) installed for your chosen OS.  Once ruby and rubygems is installed, install the bundler gem:

``` shell
gem install bundler
```

Once you have installed those, extract the monkeyking package using tar into a directory of your choosing:

```shell
tar -xvzf Monkeyking.tar.gz
```

In the extracted directory, install the prerequisite gems:
```shell
bundle install
```

### Running Monkeyking

Finally, youâ€™re ready to run Monkeyking. before running finnal command, the input CSV file must be named as `employees_salary.csv` under root directory, CSV header must be as below

``` csv
first name,last name,annual salary,super rate,payment start date
```

data in CSV must be valid, such as super rate must be a percentage, but don't worry Monkeying has a comprehensive csv validator to check input file. below is an example of valid input CSV.

``` csv
first name,last name,annual salary,super rate,payment start date
David,Rudd,60050,9%,01 March - 31 March
Ryan,Chen,120000,10%,01 March - 31 March
```

In order to make this simple, I have also provided an example file, so you can just run the following command from the extracted directory:

```shell
bundle exec rake monkeyking:output_payslip_csv
```

then the output payslip CSV file could be found under output directory named `payslips.csv`

### Development

Testing(style check/quality threshold check/Unit Test)

```
$ bundle exec rake
```


### Could be improved
1. Add a tax rule checker to check if tax rule configuration file is valid
2. Check Input CSV file existance before parsing
3. Logs
4. Running in docker environment
